# How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

### Scenario
I'm a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### About Cyclistic
Cyclistic, launched in 2016, operates a bike-share program in Chicago with 5,824 bikes across 692 stations. The program allows bikes to be unlocked from one station and returned to any other. Previously, their marketing focused on broad consumer segments and flexible pricing plans. Casual riders purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while annual memberships are available for frequent users. Financial analysis shows that annual members are more profitable. To drive future growth, the company aims to convert casual riders into annual members. Moreno, the marketing lead, plans to analyze historical bike trip data to understand customer behavior and optimize marketing strategies.

## ASK
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## PREPARE

I will be using data from [divvy_tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). All personally identifiable information has been removed. The dataframe I will be working on consists of data from January 2023 through December 2023. Each file consists of 13 columns: ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual.

### Merging data

I am merging the 12 datasets into one [table](https://github.com/jessapoy/Cyclistic/blob/main/Merging%20data.sql) to make querying easier.

## PROCESS
 
You can find the code for cleaning process of the data [here](https://github.com/jessapoy/Cyclistic/blob/main/Process.sql).

First, I verified the row count of the merged table, which totals 5,719,877 rows.
I also checked for duplicates using ride_id (which I determined to be the primary key). It returned 5,719,877 rows, which means there are no duplicates.

I also checked for any null values, which I found in:

* start_station_name_count, -- 875716 null values

* start_station_id_count, -- 875848 null values

* end_station_name_count, -- 929202 null values

* end_station_id_count, -- 929343 null values

* end_lat_count, -- 6990 null values

* end_lng_count, -- 6990 null values

Next, I created a new table called 'biketrip_merged_nonulls' by eliminating rows with null values. This step ensures a cleaner dataset for subsequent analysis.

After creating a table with no null values, I added new tables to make analysis easier.

* day_of_week: This column is created using a CASE statement that extracts the day of the week (e.g., 'SUN', 'MON', etc.) from the started_at timestamp.

* month: This column is created using a CASE statement that extracts the month (e.g., 'JAN', 'FEB', etc.) from the started_at timestamp.

* day, year: These columns are created by directly extracting the day and year from the started_at timestamp using the EXTRACT function.

* ride_length_m: This column calculates the length of the ride in minutes by taking the difference between the ended_at and started_at timestamps, using the TIMESTAMP_DIFF function.

* time: This column formats the started_at timestamp to display the time in the format "HH:MM AM/PM", using the FORMAT_TIMESTAMP function.

## ANALYZE


I looked at the average, max, and min of ride_length_m.

* avg_ride_length 15.993585462396611
* max_ride_length 1439
* min_ride_length 2

The maximum ride length returned 1439 minutes, which suggests that there is a ride in the dataset that lasted for nearly an entire day. One possibility is a data entry error, where incorrect start or end times were recorded for a ride. Additionally, system glitches or malfunctions may have led to inaccuracies in the recorded ride durations. Alternatively, it's conceivable that a user intentionally kept a bike checked out for an extended period, possibly due to forgetfulness or other reasons. 

#### Casual vs. Members : ride length
Now, let's look at how casual and member riders' ride length differ from each other:

* For "casual" riders, the longest ride lasted 1437 minutes, the shortest was 2 minutes, with an average ride duration of approximately 22.97 minutes.

* "Member" riders had a maximum ride length of 1439 minutes, a minimum of 2 minutes, and an average ride duration of around 12.12 minutes.

#### Bike Ride Usage Throughout the Week (Monday to Sunday)

Pulling the most bike ride usage throughout the week, members and casual riders combined, Saturday places first with 639,975 rides, and Monday with 540,333 rides.

Wednesday - Members: With 433,919 rides, Wednesday is the busiest day for members, indicating heightened activity midweek.

Thursday - Members: Following closely, Thursday sees 432,879 rides among members, maintaining the trend of weekday activity.

Saturday - Casual Riders: Casual riders prefer Saturdays, with 301,170 rides recorded, likely due to weekend leisure.

Sunday - Casual Riders: Sundays also show significant activity among casual riders, with 247,346 rides, suggesting weekend popularity for casual riding.

#### Bike Ride Usage: By Member Type and Month

The month of July has the highest ride count (238,190 rides) for casual riders, while August emerged as the busiest month for member riders, with 337,985 rides, likely due to favorable weather conditions during the summer season.

The months December, January, and February have the least rides for both casual and member riders, possibly due to winter weather conditions impacting outdoor activities.
